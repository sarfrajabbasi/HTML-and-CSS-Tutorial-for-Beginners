<h2>Early development</h2> 
<p> 

    The first Assassin's Creed game originated out of ideas for a sequel for Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, a 3D adaption of the original Prince of Persia games, which was made for PlayStation 2, GameCube, Xbox and other platforms. It included a number of parkour moves and combat. The Sands of Time was a critical and financial success, leading publisher Ubisoft to request Ubisoft Montreal to develop a sequel, aiming for the seventh generation of video game consoles. The Ubisoft Montreal team decided on taking the gameplay from The Sands of Time into an open world approach, taking advantage of the improved processing power to render larger spaces and crowds. Narratively, the team wanted to move away from the Prince being someone next in line for the throne but to have to work for it; combined with research into secret societies led them to focus on the Assassins, based upon the historical Hashashin sect of Ismaili Shia Islam, heavily borrowing from the novel Alamut.[1][2][3][4]
</p>
<p>

    They developed a narrative where the player would control an Assassin that served as a bodyguard for a non-playable Prince, leading them to call this game Prince of Persia: Assassin. Ubisoft was not happy with a Prince of Persia game without the Prince as the playable character, but this led to the marketing division to suggest the name Assassin's Creed, playing off the creed of the Assassins, "nothing is true; everything is permitted". Ubisoft Montreal ran with this in creating a new intellectual property, eliminating the Prince and creating the conflict between the Assassins and the Knights Templar. Further, in postulating what other assassinations they could account for throughout human history, they came onto the idea of genetic memory and created the "Animus" device and modern storyline elements, which further allowed them to explain certain facets of gameplay, such as accounting when the player fails a mission, in the same way they had done in The Sands of Time.[1]

    When it came to designing the game's world, the team set their eyes on the Holy Land in the late 12th century, primarily the cities of Masyaf (which served as the main base of the Assassins), Damascus, Acre, and Jerusalem. In recreating these cities, they strived for historical accuracy, which resulted in some gameplay elements being scrapped, such as the crossbow (which would not have been accessible in the Holy Land at that point in time). Although the events of the game took place during the Third Crusade, the player would not be a direct participant in it; however, the team still wanted players to feel immersed in the world, so they included heralds that would frequently mention the conflict.[1]

        The Ezio Trilogy
After Assassin's Creed was released in 2007 to a mostly positive reception, Ubisoft Montreal and other Ubisoft studios used the feedback to develop the sequel, which would be much more ambitious. Moving into Assassin's Creed II, the Ubisoft Montreal team recognized that parkour was underutilized in the first game, and designed the world in the sequel to feature "freerun highways" to make it easier to enter into parkour moves, using rooftops to escape pursuits or as part of an Assassin ploy.

<p> 
    Although the first game's setting received praise, the team decided to leave behind the dark and gritty towns of 12th-century Holy Land in favor of the more lively cities of 15th-century Renaissance Italy, like Florence and Venice.[5] The change in setting also meant that the game would feature a new cast of characters, including a new protagonist, Ezio Auditore da Firenze, who would be more rogue-ish than the first game's stoic Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad. Despite this, the team wanted Assassin's Creed II to feel like a proper sequel, so they opted to continue the modern-day storyline following protagonist Desmond Miles, while also including several references to Altaïr and other past Assassins. Assassin's Creed II also brought in more use of crowds as part of a means to hide in plain sight that the developers had seen used in Hitman: Blood Money, adding more to the concept of social stealth as a gameplay option.[5] Finally, Assassin's Creed II completely reworked the repetitive mission structure from the first game through numerous side activities, collectibles and other secrets.
</p>  

<p>
    These additions became a central part of the series going forward as well as other Ubisoft games like Watch Dogs, Far Cry and Ghost Recon.[5] Following its release in 2009, Assassin's Creed II received critical acclaim, being seen as an improvement over the first game in both gameplay and writing. Due to the popularity of both Ezio's character and the Renaissance setting, Ubisoft Montreal decided to follow the game with a direct sequel, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood, which was developed in under a year, releasing in 2010. The game built upon Assassin's Creed II's gameplay and storyline, and saw the introduction of a multiplayer mode to the series, as well as the titular Brotherhood system, which allowed players to recruit and train NPCs as Assassins. 
</p>
<p> The open world format was also changed; rather than featuring several smaller cities like the past two games, Brotherhood is primarily set in the city of Rome, which was the largest and most detailed setting in the series at the time.[5] The game received similar acclaim to Assassin's Creed II, with many critics and players feeling that it had perfected the Assassin's Creed formula.Brotherhood was followed in 2011 by Assassin's Creed: Revelations, which served as a conclusion to the stories of both Ezio, who was again the main protagonist, and Altaïr. The game was developed by Ubisoft Montreal with help from a few other Ubisoft studios in the time span of several months, and borrowed many ideas and concepts from Assassin's Creed: Lost Legacy, a Nintendo 3DS spin-off that had been announced at E3 2010 and later quietly cancelled.</p>

<p> 5] Unlike the other games starring Ezio, Revelations was met with a more mixed response. While the narrative was once again praised, many felt that the new setting of Constantinople was underwhelming compared to Renaissance Italy, and that the gameplay of the series was getting overly familiar and was in need of a serious rework. It was also around this time that Ubisoft decided Assassin's Creed would become an annual franchise, with at least one mainline installment releasing each year.[5]</p>

         Work on Assassin's Creed III began shortly after II's release. The developers had avoided giving Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood and Revelations numbers in their titles, because they wanted the 'true' sequel to Assassin's Creed II to be bigger in scale and feature a different time period. The game's origins can be traced back to both Ubisoft Montreal, who wanted to progress the series' narrative forward in time, and to an unattached project that had been developed at Ubisoft Singapore and featured naval ship combat. As the main team had settled into the American Revolution period for the game, they found this ship-to-ship combat system fit perfectly into the story, and redesigned the setting to incorporate it further.

<p>
Another major change in Assassin's Creed III was transitioning the parkour and freerun systems to work in the natural woodlands of 18th-century New England, which further allowed for adding trees and other vegetation within the city areas themselves, not only as part of the parkour systems but also to add to more realistic appearances, which would also continue as part of the series' ongoing design.[5] The combat and stealth systems also saw a slight rework, with players now being able to use human shields against gunfire and employ the natural environment, like trees and tall grass, to hide from enemies. 
</p>
<p>

    Narrative-wise, the team wanted to explore the morally gray areas of both the American Revolution and the Assassin-Templar conflict, and so decided to focus on a half-Native protagonist, Ratonhnhaké:ton (or Connor Kenway), who, as the son of a Templar Grand Master, gets to experience the perspectives of both the Assassins and Templars and thus realize the two sides are not so different.[5]
</p>
    <p>

        Even though Assassin's Creed III was not received as positively as the previous games in the series, the Ubisoft team noticed that most praised the additions it brought the series' gameplay, especially the ship combat, and so decided to build upon and improve them in the next game, Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag.[5] Whereas naval gameplay in III was limited to several missions, in Black Flag it was merged seamlessly with the land-based gameplay. The game world was designed to encourage exploration, replacing the traditional large cities of the series with numerous smaller islands, forts, and sunken ships, although several larger locations were still present, like Havana, Nassau, and Kingston. Adding to this, the ship combat was expanded, allowing players to board virtually any ship encountered in the open world.[5] The team also used the game as a chance to address aspects of the series' storyline which had started to become stale in their eyes. Choosing to focus on an outsider's perspective to the Assassin-Templar conflict, they set the game around the Golden Age of Piracy, with the protagonist, Edward Kenway, starting out as a pirate who only becomes involved in the conflict with the prospect of wealth at the end. Over the course of the main story, however, he comes to understand what both sides are fighting for, and ultimately joins the Assassins. Similarly, after the conclusion of Desmond Miles' story arc in Assassin's Creed III, the modern-day segments put players in the shoes of a nameless Abstergo Industries employees who is involuntarily drawn into the Assassin-Templar conflict. The team chose this approach because they believed it allowed players to more easily identify themselves in their character.[5] This trend would continue for the next three main games in the series.[5]

        After Black Flag was released to critical acclaim, Ubisoft decided to expand upon its concept in the next game, Assassin's Creed Rogue, which would serve as a conclusion to the "Kenway Saga" that started with Assassin's Creed III.[5] Developed primarily by Ubisoft Sofia, Rogue built upon Black Flag's ship combat by introducing new weapons and features, such as the ability to be boarded by enemy ships. The game's North Atlantic setting also allowed players to take advantage of the icy environment during ship battles, while the land-based gameplay saw the return of several features from earlier installments, like enemy outposts and an economy system.[5] Continuing the exploration of the morally gray area of the Assassin-Templar conflict, the game's story put players in control of an Assassin named Shay Patrick Cormac who, after feeling he has been betrayed by the Brotherhood, defects to the Templars and helps them hunt down his former Assassin allies; setting the stage for the events of Assassin's Creed III and Unity. Upon release, Rogue received generally mixed reviews, being praised for its nuanced story and the twist on the traditional series formula by playing as a Templar, while criticism was aimed at its lack of innovation in the gameplay department.[5]

        Development of Assassin's Creed Unity began shortly after the completion of Brotherhood in 2010,[6] with the core development team splitting off during the early stages of development on Assassin's Creed III.[7] As the first game in the series to be released exclusively for the eighth generation of video game consoles, Unity featured a graphical and gameplay overhaul, including refined combat and stealth mechanics, and an improved parkour system, which allowed players to make controlled ascents and descents at will. The game also saw the introduction of skill trees, character customization, and a co-op multiplayer mode to the series. The setting chosen for the game was Paris during the early years of the French Revolution, with players taking control of a new Assassin named Arno Dorian.[5] Despite its ambitiousness, Unity ultimately received mixed reviews from critics, who felt that it failed to truly innovate the series' gameplay formula and criticized its narrative, mission design, and multiplayer-oriented format. The game was also widely panned for its technical state when it released in 2014, with many players reporting graphical issues and bugs, though most of these issues were later resolved through patches, leading to some positive critical re-evaluations.[5]

        After Unity, Ubisoft released Assassin's Creed Syndicate in 2015. Developed by Ubisoft Quebec, who had assisted in the making of six previous games in the series, Syndicate built upon Unity's gameplay systems by introducing new stealth mechanics, including the ability to kidnap enemies, and new means of traversing the world, such as carriages and a Hidden Blade-mounted grapnel gun. The combat system also saw an overhaul, becoming more fast-paced due to the introduction of weapons like brass knuckles and cane swords. The game was set in 19th-century Victorian London, and was the first in the series to feature two playable protagonists, twins Jacob and Evie Frye, whom players could switch between at any time outside missions. Syndicate received generally positive reviews for its light-hearted narrative, characters, level design, and fixing most of Unity's issues, although the new combat system, vehicle gameplay, and open-world design were met with some criticism. The game also failed to reach the sale numbers of previous entries, which Ubisoft attributed to a series fatigue among players and the troubled launch of Unity.[5]
